# CapgeminiJavaCodingChallenge


Developed a REST/GET web API in Java 8+ that accepts an array of numeric inputs.

Action on the input:
Finds the highest 3 numbers.
Computes the square root of the sum of squares of the 3 highest numeric inputs.
 
Example-1 Input:

{
    “data”: [5,4,6,1]
}

Example-1 Expected Output:

{
    “output”: 8.77
}

 
Programming Languages, Frameworks and Libraries used:
1) The project is programmed in JAVA 8 Language.
2) Used Maven to manage any dependencies. 
3) Used Java Streams to compute the result.
4) Used the Spring framework to accelerate the development time for the web api. 
5) Use of junit 5 for writting unit test cases
